# ql
### Quick entry creation tool for [Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/ "Ledger").  

#### Install
Clone the repository, `chmod +x ql.py` and move ql.py somewhere in your $PATH.  
  
#### Usage
The first time you run `ql` it will try to figure out where your Ledger data  
file is located based on `$LEDGER` and `$LEDGER_FILE` environment variables.  
If nothing is found, it will just ask you.  
```  
usage: ql [-h] [-f LEDGER_FILE] [-a ACCOUNT] [-m MERCHANT] [-c CATEGORY] [-e EXPENSE] [-t AMOUNT] [--set-acct]
  
ql: Quick `ledger' entry creation tool.  
  
optional arguments:  
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  
  -f LEDGER_FILE, --file LEDGER_FILE  
                        Specify Ledger file.  
  -a ACCOUNT, --account ACCOUNT  
                        Specify account from ql's configuration file.  
  -m MERCHANT, --merchant MERCHANT  
                        Set merchant.  
  -c CATEGORY, --category CATEGORY  
                        Set category.  
  -e EXPENSE, --expense EXPENSE  
                        Set expense category.  
  -t AMOUNT, --amount AMOUNT  
                        Set dollar amount.  
  --set-acct            Add accounts to ql's configuration file.  
```  
#### Configuration File  
`ql` keeps all data in `$HOME/.qlrc`  
Here is a sample of what one might look like:  
`cat ~/.qlrc`  
> [file]  
> ledger_file = /home/robotmachine/doc/Ledger.dat  
> [acct]
> default_account = CHEQ 
> CHEQ = Assets:MyBank:Chequing  
> SAVE = Assets:MyBank:Savings  
> [merc]  
> SD = Sundance Natural Foods  
> SD_CAT = Expenses:Groceries  
> SQ = SeQUential Biofuels  
> SQ_CAT = Expenses:Auto:Fuel  
  
When using the `ql -a ACCOUNT` option, `ql` will attempt to match the entry  
with one of the accounts in the [acct] section of .qlrc  
If a match is not found, the literal string will be used.  
The same is true of the `ql -m MERCHANT` option.  
If a match is found for the merchant and merchant_CAT is present, then  
merchant_CAT will be used. If that does not match, then it will prompt  
interactively for an expense category.  

#### Examples
Everyone loves examples. The above .qlrc file is assumed for the examples.  
`ql -m SD -t 27.50` will append the following to /home/robotmachine/doc/Ledger.dat  
> 2014-11-01 * Sundance Natural Foods  
> 	Expenses:Groceries		$27.50  
> 	Assets:MyBank:Chequing
